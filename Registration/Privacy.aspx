                    Your privacy is important to SCG  (and the entities we represent) and we attach great importance to protecting
                 personal data and maintaining privacy. This policy describes the types of  personal information we may collect 
                from you, the purposes for which we use the  information, the circumstances in which we may share the information, 
                and the  steps that we take to safeguard the information to protect your privacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that participation  contact details will be kept on the SCG database, which will be used by SCG  
                and Battelle. SCG does not record or store credit card  information. Unless SCG has received an explicit 
                request from a registrant  disallowing to share his/her contact information (through the Registration Form), a list of 
                all attendees, their affiliation institutions, and contact  information as entered will be included in the 
                conference handouts. The email addresses also will be used to circulate last minute details and announcements 
                of future Battelle conferences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>The personal data we collect and why</b><br>
                    When entering your data into the  online registration form we collect this data from you for the purpose of 
                registering you for the conference. Of course, you are not required to supply  any of the information that we 
                may request. However, failure to do so will result  in our being unable to register you for the conference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Use and disclosure of your personal data</b><br>
                    By submitting the registration  form, you consent to the processing of the entered information by SCG as 
                described in this privacy statement. SCG will use the personal information to process your registration, 
                communicate with you about the conference, and  obtain your feedback in regards to the conference. In doing so, your 
                information may be transferred throughout SCG and shared with third parties who  are directly associated with 
                supporting the conference. We will not sell or  disclose your personal data to other third parties not associated with the 
                conference without your consent. If you do not want to receive post or electronic communications regarding the conference, 
                you may opt out when you  register for the conference by ticking the relevant box.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Controlling your personal data</b><br>
                    You are entitled to access any personal data about you held by SCG by sending a written request to the person named below. 
                You may be required to supply a valid means of identification as a  security precaution to assist us in preventing 
                unauthorized disclosure of your  personal information. We will process your request within the time provided by 
                applicable law. You are also entitled to have SCG modify or delete any  information that you believe is incorrect 
                or out of date. Please contact the  individual below.<br />
